However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula, cartilage, cricoid, flexible, foreign body, mainstem, obstruction, perichondrium, stenosis, stent, subglottic, swallowing, trachea, tracheal, tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy, shiley single cannula tracheostomy, shiley single cannula, single cannula tracheostomy, thyroid isthmus, stent material, tracheostomy tube, tube, thyroid, ","Preoperative diagnoses,airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. ,postoperative diagnoses,airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis with foreign body in the trachea. ,operation performed,neck exploration;

4085, A woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss. , Consult - History and Phy., Wound Care Consult ,"TYPE OF CONSULTATION:,  Wound care consult.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for prior ileojejunal bypass for weight loss (1980) and then subsequent gastric banding (2002 Dr. X) who was transferred to this facility following a complicated surgical and postoperative course after takedown of the prior gastroplasty and bypass (07/08/2008, Dr. Y).  The patient has been followed by Cardiothoracic Surgery (Dr. Z) as an outpatient.  She had a history of daily postprandial vomiting, regurgitation, and heartburn.  She underwent a preop assessment of her GERD and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying studies, which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying.  Preoperative barium swallow demonstrated moderated esophageal dysmotility with incomplete emptying and a small hiatal hernia.  It was recommended that she undergo an exploratory laparotomy and possible redo fundoplication and possible gastrectomy.  She had already undergone multiple EGDs with dilatations without success.  She continued to have abdominal discomfort.,On 07/07/2008, she was admitted to hospital.  She underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, repair of hiatal hernia, small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis, extensive lysis of adhesions, insertion of a red-rubber J tube, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  She also had her ileojejunal bypass reversed.  Postoperatively, she was able to be extubated.  She was started on TPN, given the risk of not being able to tolerate enteral nutrition.  Her operative note confirmed that the stomach pouch was enlarged with outlet obstruction where the band was.  There was 2 hours of extensive lysis of adhesions.  It took 2 hours to identify the colon.  A defect was repaired in the transverse colon.  The bypass segment of the anastomosis was seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum, which was divided and the proximal jejunum was reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel.  A red feeding tube was placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feeds.  The hiatal hernia was repaired as noted.  The obstructed proximal gastric segment was resected.  An anastomosis was made between the proximal intestine and the stomach and distal esophagus with Dor fundoplication.  Omentectomy was performed due to devascularization.  The wound was able to be closed with staples.,Postoperatively, the patient was started on IV antibiotics.  She was able to be extubated.  However, on 07/14/2008, she coded with shortness of breath and chest pain.  She had respiratory failure, required endotracheal intubation and ICU management.  CT scan of the abdomen and the pelvis confirmed that she had an anastomotic leak.  Sputum cultures were positive ESBL Klebsiella.  Blood cultures were negative.  She was managed closely for sepsis with an elevated white cell count.  She was also febrile.  Her chest x-ray also showed left lower lobe consolidation.  She had scattered contrast material in the anterior abdomen and left upper quadrant due to the anastomotic leak.  Her antibiotics were adjusted.  Of note, the patient did have a JP drain placed out to the surface during her initial surgery.  Followup CT scan on 07/16/2008 confirmed the anastomosis as the likely site of a fistula, as there was continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum as well as the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  No enteric contrast was seen surrounding the patient's known GE junction leak.  A JP drain was noted at the posterior aspect of the fundoplication.  There was only a small amount of pelvic fluid.  Follow up scan again on 07/25/2008 showed no abscess formation.  On 08/05/2008, she did underwent an advancement of the #14 French red-rubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel.  At the beginning of the procedure, the catheter did appear to traverse through an anastomotic suture line in the wound dehiscence.  At some point during her course, the patient did undergo a second operative procedure, but I do not have any operative note at this time.  She subsequently was left with a large open abdominal defect, which was being managed by the wound care nurses, which at the time of her transfer to this facility was being managed with a ""wound manager system."" to low-continuous wall suction.  She was also transferred on tube feedings via the red rubber catheter 20 mL per hour.  She is only to have her tube feeds increased by 10 mL a week to ensure tolerance.  During her course, she was started on TPN.  She was transferred on TPN here.,At the time of her transfer, the patient was no longer on IV antibiotics.  She is on Fragmin for DVT prophylaxis.  During her course, she did have to undergo a tracheostomy.  This has subsequently been removed and this site is healing.  The tracheostomy was removed on 08/06/2008, I believe.  At the time of her tracheostomy (on 07/22/2008), the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which showed some secretions in the left airway (right was clear), which did not appear to be purulent.  Of note also, pathology of her partial stomach resection showed Helicobacter pylori gastritis.  There were no other significant abnormalities noted in the small intestine or omentum.  On 08/11/2008, the patient was transferred to HealthSouth Monroeville LTAC for continued medical management, wound care, and rehab therapies.1,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,History of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy - on Lyrica and Cymbalta preoperatively.

Gait and transfers not tested.,SUMMARY: , In summary, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a remote history of ileojejunal bypass followed by gastric banding to facilitate weight loss.  However, she subsequently developed reflux associated with postprandial vomiting, which was found to be secondary to esophageal retention.  On 07/08/2008, she underwent exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and Dor fundoplication, hiatal hernia repair, small bowel resection, and lysis of adhesions.  She has had a fairly rocky postoperative course and has subsequently underwent some type of re-exploration after she was noted to have enteric contents draining from her JP drain with confirmed anastomotic leak.  She has undergone placement on an NG tube.  At present, she is on enteral feeds as well as TPN.  During all these, she also coded and had respiratory failure, requiring vent management, but this has improved.  Her trach has been removed and this site is healing.  From the wound standpoint, her largest problem at this point is the abdominal wound, which is open.  A wound manager system is currently in place, which is connected to low intermittent wall suction for drainage of the enteral contents still present. At present, the drainage is quite yellow in appearance.  She has no significant complaints of pain at this time.  At some point in her notes, there was mention of a negative pressure wound therapy being used to this wound, but this cannot be confirmed at this time.  I will plan to contact Dr. Z's office to see whether or not they wanted to resume a wound VAC system to this wound.  For now, we will continue with wound manager system.  We will need to keep track of in's and out's of drainage from this site.  Her fluid status will need to be monitored.  In an attempt to get her mobilized, we will need extra care to be sure that this wound dressing/management system stays in place.  She is eager and motivated to get mobilized.  We will plan to ask Plastic (Dr. A) to be involved in following this wound also.  Again, I will plan to call the surgeon's office for further directions.  She is to follow up with Dr. Z in 2 weeks.,Later in afternoon, I was able to reach Dr. Z's office.  I was called back by one of his nurses, who advised me that a wound VAC (negative pressure wound therapy) was not to be used on this wound.  They are using the wound manager system.  She did report that the confusion came about with the inability during her discharge summary dictation that she was only able to cite a ""wound VAC"" when describing the system that was in place on the patient.  She was using a formatted discharge summary program.  At present, the patient has had some leakage from the system.  According to my discussion with our wound care coordinator at this time, this system has been removed, with leakage repaired, and replaced with another wound manager system with suctioning continuing.  Pictures were also taken of the wound bed.  There were several staples apparently in place.  I was not present at the time that this system had to be changed.",,",history of present illness:,  the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a past medical history significant for prior ileojejunal bypass for weight loss (1980) and then subsequent gastric banding (2002 dr. x) who was transferred to this facility following a complicated surgical and postoperative course after takedown of the prior gastroplasty and bypass (07/08/2008, dr. y).  she underwent a preop assessment of her gerd and postprandial vomiting including nuclear gastric emptying studies, which showed increased esophageal retention with normal gastric emptying.  she underwent an exploratory laparotomy with esophagogastrectomy with esophagogastric anastomosis and dor fundoplication, repair of hiatal hernia, small bowel resection x2 with primary anastomosis, extensive lysis of adhesions, insertion of a red-rubber j tube, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.  the bypass segment of the anastomosis was seen between the proximal jejunum and the distal ileum, which was divided and the proximal jejunum was reconnected to the atretic blind limb of the small bowel.  a red feeding tube was placed proximal to the anastomosis then tended to cross the anastomosis into the distal atretic small bowel for enteral feeds.  followup ct scan on 07/16/2008 confirmed the anastomosis as the likely site of a fistula, as there was continued extraluminal enteric contrast seen within anterior abdomen just beneath the peritoneum as well as the left upper quadrant adjacent to the spleen.  on 08/05/2008, she did underwent an advancement of the #14 french red-rubber catheter feeding tube distal to the dehiscence of fistula into the distal small bowel.  at some point during her course, the patient did undergo a second operative procedure, but i do not have any operative note at this time.  she subsequently was left with a large open abdominal defect, which was being managed by the wound care nurses, which at the time of her transfer to this facility was being managed with a ""wound manager system.""  at the time of her tracheostomy (on 07/22/2008), the patient also underwent a flexible bronchoscopy, which showed some secretions in the left airway (right was clear), which did not appear to be purulent.  on 08/11/2008, the patient was transferred to healthsouth monroeville ltac for continued medical management, wound care, and rehab therapies.1,past medical history:  ,history of diabetes with peripheral neuropathy -

Starting from the left side local anesthetic was used for skin wheal just lateral superior to the 10 o'clock position of the lateral aspect of the T11 pedicle on the left.  The 13-gauge needle and trocar were then taken and placed to 10 o'clock position on the pedicle.  At this point using AP and lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle and trocar were advanced into the vertebral body using the fluoroscopic images and making sure that the needle was lateral to the medial wall of the pedicle of the pedicle at all times.  Once the vertebral body was entered then using lateral fluoroscopic views, the needle was advanced to the junction of the anterior one third and posterior two thirds of the body.  At this point polymethylmethacrylate was mixed for 60 seconds.  Once the consistency had hardened and the __________ was gone, incremental dose of the cement were injected into the vertebral body.  It was immediately seen that the cement was going cephalad into the vertebral body and was exiting through the crack in the vertebra.  A total 1.2 cc of cement was injected.  On lateral view, the cement crushed to the right side as well.  There was some dye infiltration into the disk space.  There was no dye taken whatsoever into the posterior aspect of the epidural space or intrathecal canal.,At this point, as the needle was slowly withdrawn under lateral fluoroscopic images, visualization was maintained to ensure that none of the cement was withdrawn posteriorly into the epidural space.  Once the needle was withdrawn safely pressure was held over the site for three minutes.  There were no complications.

All the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with Betadine soap and then painted with Betadine solution and draped in usual fashion.,The xenograft was not adhered at all and was easily removed.  There was some, what appeared to be a seropurulent exudate at the bottom of the incision.  This was towards the abdominal end, under the xenograft.,The graft was fully exposed and it was pulsatile.  We then proceeded to use a pulse spray with bacitracin clindamycin solution to clean up the graft.  A few areas of necrotic skin and subcutaneous tissue were debrided.  Prior to this, samples were taken for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.,Normal saline 3000 cc was used for the irrigation and at the end of that the wound appeared much cleaner and we proceeded to insert the sponges to put a VAC system to it.  There was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the VAC in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound.  Prior to that, I had inserted a number of Vesseloops through the edges of the skin and I proceeded to approximate those on top of the VAC sponge.  Multiple layers were applied to seal the system, which was suctioned and appeared to be working satisfactorily.,The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the ICU for recovery.","surgery, open wound, prosthetic vascular graft, closure of wound, surgisis, peripheral vascular disease, wound debridement, subcutaneous tissue, vac insertion, wound, betadine, debridement, xenograft, insertion,"," open wound from right axilla to abdomen with a prosthetic vascular graft, possibly infected.  open wound from right axilla to abdomen with a prosthetic vascular graft, possibly infected.  wound debridement with removal of surgisis xenograft and debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue.  vac insertion.,description of procedure:,  after obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where a general anesthetic was given.  all the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with betadine soap and then painted with betadine solution and draped in usual fashion. ,normal saline 3000 cc was used for the irrigation and at the end of that the wound appeared much cleaner and we proceeded to insert the sponges to put a vac system to it.  there was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the vac in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound."," open wound from right axilla to abdomen with a prosthetic vascular graft, possibly infected.  open wound from right axilla to abdomen with a prosthetic vascular graft, possibly infected.  wound debridement with removal of surgisis xenograft and debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue.  vac insertion.,description of procedure:,  after obtaining an informed consent, the patient was brought to the operating room where a general anesthetic was given.  all the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with betadine soap and then painted with betadine solution and draped in usual fashion.  there was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the vac in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound. ,the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the icu for recovery.","All the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with betadine soap and then painted with betadine solution and draped in usual fashion.,the xenograft was not adhered at all and was easily removed.Prior to this, samples were taken for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.,normal saline 3000 cc was used for the irrigation and at the end of that the wound appeared much cleaner and we proceeded to insert the sponges to put a vac system to it.There was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the vac in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound.Prior to that, i had inserted a number of vesseloops through the edges of the skin and i proceeded to approximate those on top of the vac sponge.Multiple layers were applied to seal the system, which was suctioned and appeared to be working satisfactorily.,the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the icu for recovery.","Wound debridement with removal of surgisis xenograft and debridement of skin and subcutaneous tissue.,2.All the staples holding the xenograft were removed as well as all the dressings and the area was prepped with betadine soap and then painted with betadine solution and draped in usual fashion.,the xenograft was not adhered at all and was easily removed.Prior to this, samples were taken for aerobic and anaerobic cultures.,normal saline 3000 cc was used for the irrigation and at the end of that the wound appeared much cleaner and we proceeded to insert the sponges to put a vac system to it.There was a separate incision, which was bridged __________ to the incision of the abdomen, which we also put a sponge in it after irrigating it and we put the vac in the main wound and we created a bridge to the second and more minor wound.Multiple layers were applied to seal the system, which was suctioned and appeared to be working satisfactorily.,the patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the icu for recovery."
